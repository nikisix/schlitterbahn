_Overview_

Our general approach can be divided into the following steps:
    Load
    Clean
    Impute
    Temporal Segmentation
    Merge
    Feature Engineering
    Feature Importance
    Model Training
    Feature Elimination

Special notes on the above steps may be found below.


_Temporal Segmentation_

The dataset was segmented into six-month intervals. Training data from several preceding intervals were used to predict the subsequent interval.


_Feature Engineering_

Several fields were added to the work order:
    previous failure time
    previous failure count
    time since previous failure

A geo-spatial network link estimation was performed to determine the neighbors of each pipe (a strong indicator of connectivity).  The features created from this analysis are relative to a given pipe, and include include:
    number of neighboring pipes
    materials of neighboring pipes
    number of total failures of all neighboring pipes

Time series centric approach was also used in feature engineering focused on identifying seasonality in the work order dataset and creating features from it; including:

_Model Training_

Many different models were trained from the prepared dataset and compared with respect to the outcome criteria. The best model was tested in future time-intervals to validate its robustness to the myriad of changing conditions that can effect pipe failure over time.
